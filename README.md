# gan_digits
Generative Adversarial Network project in which we generate new pictures of digits.

We implemented ready-to-use pipeline functions for model training and inference. 

Try it on your own using [this script](https://github.com/blawok/gan_digits/blob/master/generate_digits.R)

> Our GAN implementation is inspired by: https://github.com/LeeGyeongTak/generative-adversarial-networks-

## Full pipeline flowchart

User can choose if he wants to train a new model or use one of already trained. If the user selects to train a new model, he can use his own data or utilize our dataset. After training, user can plot images of created digits, save them as .png or save arrays in csv format.

## Artificial threes:
Images of digit *3* created by our pipeline after just few epochs. User can display created digits during the training. After generation they can be saved in 28x28 pixels format.
